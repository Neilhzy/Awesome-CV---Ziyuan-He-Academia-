	abstract = {Neutrophils, basophils, and monocytes are continuously produced in bone marrow via myelopoiesis, circulate in blood, and are eventually removed from circulation to maintain homeostasis. To quantitate the kinetics of myeloid cell movement during homeostasis, we applied 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine pulse labeling in healthy rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) followed by hematology and flow cytometry analyses. Results were applied to a mathematical model, and the blood circulating half-life and daily production, respectively, of each cell type from macaques aged 5{\textendash}10 y old were calculated for neutrophils (1.63 {\textpm} 0.16 d, 1.42 {\texttimes} 109 cells/l/d), basophils (1.78 {\textpm} 0.30 d, 5.89 {\texttimes} 106 cells/l/d), and CD14+CD16- classical monocytes (1.01 {\textpm} 0.15 d, 3.09 {\texttimes} 108 cells/l/d). Classical monocytes were released into the blood circulation as early as 1 d after dividing, whereas neutrophils remained in bone marrow 4{\textendash}5 d before being released. Among granulocytes, neutrophils and basophils exhibited distinct kinetics in bone marrow maturation time and blood circulation. With increasing chronological age, there was a significant decrease in daily production of neutrophils and basophils, but the half-life of these granulocytes remained unchanged between 3 and 19 y of age. In contrast, daily production of classical monocytes remained stable through 19 y of age but exhibited a significant decline in half-life. These results demonstrated relatively short half-lives and continuous replenishment of neutrophils, basophils, and classical monocytes during homeostasis in adult rhesus macaques with compensations observed during increasing chronological age.},
